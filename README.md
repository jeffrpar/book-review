# Book Review App

The goal of this project is to create a full stack web application for avid readers and bookworms! The user should be able to create a review of a book, and other users should be able to comment on the review. The user will need to be logged in to an account in order to create a post/comment, but any user will be able to read reviews and comments.

On the landing page for the app, we would show books that have been reviewed, which the user would be able to interact with to get more info. There will also be a page for a user profile, so that a user can see info about other users such as their reviews and comments. We would also like to include a settings page for the user to update the information such as name or password.


## User Account: Users can register and create their own accounts. They can upload books, manage their book list, 

## Book Listing: Users can browse all available books.  users can search for books they want based on the title, author, or other keywords.

## Book Details: Each book has a detailed page displaying the book's information, including the title, author, cover image, description, and owner information. Users can request to exchange or purchase the book on this page.

## Exchange and Purchase: Users can request to exchange or purchase books from other users. If the request is accepted, the system will handle the exchange or purchase logic, including updating the owner information of the book.

## Book Reviews: Users can review the books they exchanged or purchased. Their reviews will be displayed on the book's detail page and providing a reference for other users.

## User Profile: Users can view and edit their personal information, including their username, email address, and their book list.
