## Installation

1. Clone the repo into the desired location using the terminal command: `git clone https://github.com/jeffrpar/book-review.git`

2. Open the local repository using VS Code. If you do not have VS Code installed, you can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

3. Use the VS Code terminal and type `npm i` to install the dependencies required by the application.

4. Rename `.env.EXAMPLE` to `.env` and enter your MySQL password into the `DB_PASSWORD` field. You can learn more about setting up MySQL here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/

5. Now that the application can connect to MySQL, you must create database using the schema.sql file. Using the terminal from the app directory, type `mysql -u root -p` which will prompt you for your MySQL password. Once your password is submitted, type `source db/schema.sql;` which will create a database for the app to use. Type `exit` to exit from MySQL in the terminal.

6. Insert data into the database by typing the command `npm run seed` into the terminal, which will run a script to seed data.

7. You can then use the command `npm start` to run the application on a local server.

## Usage

This app can be used to look up book recommendations and purchase recommended books through amazon links.
