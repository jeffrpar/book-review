# Book Review App

The goal of this project is to create a full stack web application for avid readers and bookworms! The user should be able to create a review of a book, and other users should be able to comment on the review. The user will need to be logged in to an account in order to create a post/comment, but any user will be able to read reviews and comments.

On the landing page for the app, we would show books that have been reviewed, which the user would be able to interact with to get more info. There will also be a page for a user profile, so that a user can see info about other users such as their reviews and comments. We would also like to include a settings page for the user to update the information such as name or password.
